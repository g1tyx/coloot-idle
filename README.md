# Coloot - Idle Loot Collector

![Game Screenshot](./screenshot.png)

Fight Monsters and find Loot to keep getting stronger! Level up Prestige Crystals and buy Artifacts.

This Game is very inspired by Idle Loot Quest made by TogCog LLC: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topcog.idlelootquest

# State of the Game

Basically finished, this is what I can think of that might need some polish:

* Balance past Level 100
* Better Enemy Sprites
* Misc Changes and Bug Fixes
* Better Help if unclear (I hope most mechanics explain themselves), the less Help text the better
* Progressive Web App with offline support

It's a bit early but if I don't publish it now I might never get around to do it :P

# About PRs and Mods

I view this more of a personal project, so I won't be keen on merging PRs, but Mods are very welcome! Refer to the [MIT License](./LICENSE) attached to this Repository.

It would be nice if all mods stay free and open source.
